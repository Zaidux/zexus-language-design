# Zexus v1.5: The Ecosystem & Interoperability Release

The goal of v1.5 would be to make Zexus incredibly easy to adopt and use with existing technologies.

 * Polyglot Support: Implement the use language "javascript" { ... } feature, allowing developers to leverage existing code and libraries (like React) directly within Zexus.

 * Automatic Code Migration Tool (zx migrate): Build the codemod tool that automatically updates older Zexus code to the latest version's syntax.

 * Mature Tooling:
   * A stable, feature-rich version of the Zexus Package Manager (zpm).

   * Official syntax highlighting and code-completion extensions for popular editors like VS Code.

# Zexus v2.0: The Power & Performance Release

The goal of v2.0 would be to unlock high-performance capabilities for advanced users.

 * "Unsafe" Escape Hatch: Implement the manual { ... } or unsafe { ... } block for low-level memory manipulation and interfacing with C libraries.

 * Advanced Concurrency Model: Formalize the memory and ownership model to deliver on the "fearless concurrency" promise in a provably safe way.

 * Performance Optimizations: Introduce a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler or an ahead-of-time compiler that translates Zexus code to optimized bytecode or native machine code.

 * Expanded Standard Library: Add specialized libraries for tasks like 2D/3D graphics or high-performance networking.
