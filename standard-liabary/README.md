# The Zexus Standard Library

The Zexus Standard Library is the built-in toolkit of essential modules and data structures that are available in every Zexus program by default.

The goal of the standard library is to provide a powerful, consistent, and easy-to-use set of tools for common programming tasks, so you don't have to rely on external libraries for basic functionality.

This includes, but is not limited to:

* **Core Data Structures:** مثل `List` و `Map` for organizing data.
* **Text Manipulation:** For working with strings of text.
* **Math:** A module for common mathematical operations.
* **Date & Time:** For handling dates, times, and durations.
* **Filesystem:** For reading and writing files.
* **Networking:** For making basic web requests.
